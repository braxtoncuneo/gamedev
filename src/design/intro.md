# Game Design


A while back, the authors Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, and Robert Zubek proposed a model for the formal analysis of game design. {{footnote: [Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, Robert Zubek. *MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research*.](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/pubs/MDA.pdf)}}
There are other philosophies for interpreting games, but we will be using this framework to frame our (rather limited) discussion of game design.

This framework is structured around:
- **mechanics** : the rules of a game
- **dynamics** : the systems of behavior created through mechanics (alongside the content used in conjunction with those mechanics)
- **aesthetics** : the player-oriented outcomes of a game

This chapter will focus on **mechanics** and **aesthetics** specifically, since **dynamics** involves more abstract, emergent behavior.

This discussion is provided to help orient those who are new to game development.
It can be difficult to determine priorities in game design, since the design space and set of possible goals are so vast.
This issue is particularly important for novice game developers, because it is important to start off with smaller games.
It is very easy to allow scope creep when developing games, because they are fun project to work on, but the number of features in a game does not correspond with its quality.

When going over these elements of game design, keep in mind that it is best to focus on completing a **minimum viable product** before investing in cool, but unnecessary content.
