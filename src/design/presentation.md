# Presentation

The same game mechanics and gameplay can be represented in a wide variety of ways.
Just ask Hasbro, which has published countless re-interpretations of Monopoly.

If you try hard enough, you can strip out all the narrative/thematic components of a game until it is a mathematical description of relevant entities and behaviors.
However, there are many great games that would become unpleasant and unrecognizable if they were given such a treatment.

Assuming you aren't in an absurd cash-cow situation like Monopoly, you likely won't have the resources to try hundreds of complete re-presentations of your game's core mechanics.
Furthermore, many games don't start off as a pure, abstract skeleton of game mechanics and gameplay.
If you are beginning a game development project with some foundational narrative/thematic concept in mind there will necessarily be restrictions in how your game is presented to players.

To better work within these constraints, and to more effectively/economically communicate our story/themes/mechanics, we must pay close attention to how they relate to one-another. In addition, we must pay attention to how the player may interpret what we present to them.

## Narrative

Narrative is a foundational component of many games.
However, this book was written for an 11-week CS course that specifically targets software-related skills.
The study of video games as media is too complex to fit into a single course, let alone as a subsection of a single chapter of a textbook.

If you are interested in game critique, consider looking through the [Games Media Analysis](../appendix/media.md) subchapter of the appendix.
