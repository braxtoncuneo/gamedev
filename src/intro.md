# Introduction

Before the advent of modern computers, the scope of interactive art was rather limited.
Reproducible forms of interactive art (i.e. clockwork toys) were labor-intensive to produce, and their complexity was constrained by the practicalities of design and fabrication.
More complex/flexible forms of interactive art (i.e. interactive theater, theme parks) required people to act as decision makers, formulating responses to the actions of participants.

With the advent of modern computers we now have cheap, fast, and reliable devices to act as decision makers.
This enables the creation of staggeringly complex, reproducible, interactive art, but we are now faced with the challenge of designing them.
As many software developers can attest, while computers are powerful, getting them to behave properly is tricky.
Getting a computer to produce an interactive experience following a curated system of behavior is a pretty tall order.


## Who this Book is For


This book is here to provide a framework for people to understand and apply the fundamental tools and concepts of game development.
This includes:
- Game Design
- Game Engines
- Graphics
- Simulation
- Procedural Generation
- Relevant programming patterns
- Relevant mathematics

*(Not necessarily in that order)*

Interactive experiences can involve any behavior the creator can imagine and implement.
Unsurprisingly, this set of behaviors is very, *very*, ***very*** large, and includes the simulation of behaviors that even experts struggle to model/understand.
Which set of behaviors is best to evoke the desired response from users also introduces the complex world of media studies.
Quite reasonably, this cannot be covered in an 11-week class, so we'll be focusing on a curated selection of fundamental concepts, common use cases, and pertinent examples.

Ideally, by the end of this book, we'll have a solid foundation which you can build upon through practice and self-education.

This book assumes that you have some experience with systems programming, though some review of systems concepts is provided to help frame discussion.
This book also assumes that you know C++, which will be used for most included code snippets.
We will also be introducing and working with glsl, which draws heavily from C++.
Some other programming languages are shown, but in-depth knowledge of them isn't crucial.



## How to Read this Book

This book is ordered to approximate the order subjects will be covered in the course, but it is also structured as a quick reference.
Feel free to read wherever your curiosity takes you.

This book is a living document, so parts may change, appear, or disappear as the term progresses or as the course is refined.


## Course Materials

The course this book is written for uses some closed-source code.
Efforts are being made to find suitable replacements that can be published openly.
Until then, whatever code that can be published will be.
